# ðŸ§¾ Public Finance FP&A Analysis â€“ Budget vs Actuals & Anomaly Detection  
**Dataset:** [Revenue Budget & Financial Plan â€“ City of New York (Open Data Portal)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Revenue-Budget-Financial-Plan-Exec-Adpt-Prel/ugzk-a6x4)  

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview  

This project analyzes **New York Cityâ€™s historical revenue budgets and actual receipts** to understand budget accuracy, detect anomalies, and visualize fiscal trends.  

The goal was to simulate the kind of **Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A)** work done in enterprise finance â€” turning raw financial data into actionable insights through metrics, visualizations, and automation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  

1. **Compare Budget vs Actuals** across revenue categories and fiscal years.  
2. **Quantify variance and forecast accuracy** by revenue stream.  
3. **Detect anomalies** â€” large deviations between planned and actual revenues.  
4. **Visualize fiscal performance** via an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
5. **Summarize insights** that inform financial decision-making and planning.

## ðŸ§© Dataset Details  

**Source:** NYC Open Data â€“ *Revenue Budget & Financial Plan (Exec/Adpt/Prel)*  
**Scope:** Fiscal revenue projections and actual receipts for multiple years.  

The NYC Financial Plan dataset (51k records, FY2017â€“2025) captures multi-year budget and revenue actuals across ~70 revenue classes. The data is clean, with minimal nulls and strong fiscal coverage. Tax-related and intergovernmental revenue dominate, giving a robust base for FP&A-style KPI analysis â€” focusing on forecast accuracy, variance attribution, and anomaly detection.

**Key Columns Used:**
| Column | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `Fiscal_Year` | City fiscal year |
| `Revenue_Class` | Main category (e.g., Taxes, Federal Aid, Misc Revenue) |
| `Revenue_Category` | Subcategory of revenue |
| `Adopted_Budget` | Final approved budget |
| `Executive_Budget` | Mid-year adjusted budget |
| `Actual_Receipts` | Actual realized revenue |
| `Revenue_Code` | Unique identifier for each source |

## ðŸ§® Analytical Approach  

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Imported and cleaned dataset using Python (`pandas`)  
- Standardized column names and numeric formatting  
- Filtered fiscal years for consistency and relevance  

### 2. KPI Calculations  
| KPI | Formula | Purpose |
|-----|----------|----------|
| **Variance ($)** | `Actual_Receipts - Adopted_Budget` | Dollar difference |
| **Variance %** | `(Variance / Adopted_Budget) * 100` | Relative deviation |
| **Forecast Accuracy** | `1 - abs(Variance %) / 100` | Measure of budget reliability |

### 3. Anomaly Detection  
Implemented rule-based and statistical checks:
- Flagged any revenue category with **Variance % > Â±15%**
- Calculated Z-scores to highlight outliers beyond Â±2 std dev  
- Summarized flagged items by year and revenue class  

### 4. Visualization  
Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** featuring:
- Budget vs Actual trends by year  
- Variance waterfall chart  
- Forecast accuracy heatmap  
- Anomaly flags by revenue category  
- Drill-down filters for fiscal year and revenue class

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights (Sample Findings)  

- **Federal Categorical Aid** consistently underperformed vs budget in multiple fiscal years.  
- **Property Tax Revenue** overperformed post-2018, driving strong actual results.  
- **2020â€“2021** showed major anomalies in multiple revenue sources, aligning with COVID-related impacts.  
- Average **budget forecast accuracy** across all categories was **~86%**, suggesting relatively conservative forecasting.
